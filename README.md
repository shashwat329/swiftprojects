# 100 Days of Swift

Learning Swift from scratch. I will be following [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) by **Paul Hudson**.
Here i m going to create projects of 100 days of swift(this is the Continuation of 100 days of swift from day 16)

## Basic Commands That I'm Using

To open Xcode using Mac terminal:
```bash
cd code/swift # To get inside the directory
open -a Xcode [file_name]
```
```bash
To use Git on Mac terminal:
git add . #to add all file to staging area
git commit -m"commit msg" # To snapshot of the code
git push # To push your local repo on github
```
```bash

```
